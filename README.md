# Machine Learning with Evolutionary Parameter Tuning for Singing Registers Classification

Behind the human voice production, there is a complex biological mechanism that generates and modulates sound. Recent research has explored the utility of Machine Learning (ML) for analyzing singing voice characteristics. However, the classification efficiency reported in such research works suggests the possibility of improvement. In addition, there is also scope for further improvement through the application of still under-utilized optimization techniques. Thus, the present article proposes a novel approach that leverages the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm to optimize hyperparameters within three selected ML models, with the aim of classifying of singing voice registers, i.e chest, mixed, and head registers). To develop the present study, a dataset of 350 audio files encompassing the three aforementioned registers was constructed. Then, the TSFEL Python library was employed to retrieve 18 temporal information from the audio signals for subsequent classification by the employed ML models. The obtained findings demonstrated that Extreme Gradient Boosting model, optimized with DE, achieved an average classification accuracy of 98.10%, thus indicating the efficacy of the proposed approach for singing voice register classification.
